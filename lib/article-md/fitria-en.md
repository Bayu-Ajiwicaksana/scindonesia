Until now, the empowerment program is still the paradigm and path of choice used to improve people's standard of living, especially in developing countries, because empowerment itself has the aim of increasing the capacity and independence of the community to overcome various problems that must be faced, especially problems of poverty and social inequality.

In simple terms, empowerment can be interpreted as maximizing all the potential that society has to improve socio-economic levels through self-help activities.

Community empowerment programs should be programs that are based on community participation _(Community Based Development)_, where active participation from members of society or the community itself is expected to always exist as a form of aspiration and determination of solutions to problems that arise. This is an important thing, where community members not only act as objects but also become subjects or integral parts in the planning and decision making process in the implementation of various empowerment programs.

So what are the steps in determining and implementing the right empowerment program so that it has a massive impact on society or the community?

## Steps to Determine and Implement Community Empowerment Programs

Summarizing from Mardikanto and Soebianto (2013), there are several steps or stages in determining community empowerment programs that can be carried out;

**_First,_** Location/Region Selection Stage. Location or area selection can be done by considering the existing social, economic, environmental and infrastructure data of an area. Then location priorities are determined by involving relevant stakeholders through deliberations between villages/districts/cities/regions. At the village level, the location of activities is determined based on agreement in the village deliberation forum and the determination of proposals through the Village RPJM which originates from the idea exploration stage.

**_Second,_** Identify Community Problems and Potential. At this stage, a survey or feasibility study can be carried out to identify the problems faced by the community at various levels, then map the potential and resources owned by the community, including human, natural, cultural and institutional resources.

**_Third,_** Community Empowerment Program Planning. This stage is an action plan for community empowerment activities which includes determining the program's vision and mission, program targets, preparing a logical framework or program logframe, preparing a program budget (which includes funding sources, fund management mechanisms and fund accountability), as well as preparing a timeline or duration of work.

**_Fourth_,** Community Empowerment Socialization. Socialization is carried out directly to the community in the target location of the activity through existing empowerment cadres, or through deliberation at meeting forums. Apart from that, socialization can also be carried out through various existing social media such as village information boards, notice boards, as well as print and electronic media. This socialization process has proven to be very important in determining the community's interest in playing an active role and being directly involved in the program.

**_Fifth,_** Community Empowerment Program Implementation Process. This stage is the implementation or execution stage of the planned empowerment program. In this case, many things can be done, such as advocacy, outreach, communication with relevant stakeholders, both internal and external. Then facilitate or guide the program to the target community or beneficiaries. As well as carrying out routine monitoring or supervision of community empowerment programs to ensure that activities run according to plan.

**_Sixth,_** Evaluation of Community Empowerment Programs*.* At this stage, measurements and assessments of the results of the community empowerment program that have been implemented are carried out. At this stage, data and information related to program implementation can be collected, then analyzed the data and information using various predetermined tools/methods/techniques. After obtaining the value results through the analysis, they are expressed in the form of reporting the evaluation results which are equipped with suggestions or input for improving the program.

**_Seventh,_**, Program Establishment. At this stage, a plan map can be made with various approaches as guidance when the empowerment program is completed or stopped.

## Important Strategies in Community Empowerment

In order to implement the steps or stages of community empowerment, the first thing that needs to be considered is the approach taken by the community or community itself. Approach is important and crucial as a strategy for implementing community empowerment. Quoted from the Community Empowerment Activity Module by Ristekdikti (2020), several approaches that are often used as references include;

**_First,_** _Collaborative Approach_. This approach refers to the relationship between the party providing empowerment activities and the target community. This activity listens and responds to ideas about what to do and how to do it within the community.

**_Second,_** _Participatory Approach_. This approach is more about inviting the community to take part in all lines of community activities, in order to increase community capacity and knowledge.

**_Third,_** _Inclusive Approach_. In this approach, the community is considered equal to the partners or co-workers of those providing empowerment activities.

**_Fourth_,** _Quality Assurance-Oriented_. This approach refers to providing quality control, safety, accessibility, and level of service acceptability. Here it will create agreement, cohesion and community engagement in providing full services.

**_Fifth,_** _Bottom-Up Approach_. This approach refers to building relationships from the bottom up, starting from relationships between communities, recipients and providers of empowerment activities, between institutions and systems above them.

Referring to the explanations above, it is hoped that improving the quality of human resources in various regions through empowerment programs will become one of the efforts to support the Sustainable Development Program with the output of a more capable, independent, skilled and competitive community. In this concept, it is necessary to view society as a subject of development, not as a mere object, so that society can enjoy real and massive results. Apart from that, synergy between the government and the private sector is also an important aspect in supporting the implementation of empowerment programs. The government also needs to improve coordination with various parties, it needs to listen more and accept the aspirations of the community. And we also need to be aware of the importance of the presence and participation of the community in efforts to improve collective prosperity.
