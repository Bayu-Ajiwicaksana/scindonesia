# Community Empowerment Program conducted by UNDP

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) plays a significant role in community empowerment in Indonesia through various initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty, reducing inequality, and promoting inclusive economic growth. These programs are designed to strengthen the capacities of individuals and communities, enabling them to achieve independence and sustainable well-being. In its program implementation in Indonesia, UNDP has several program focuses, including:

# 1. Program Pahlawan Ekonomi Nusantara (PENA)

The Pahlawan Ekonomi Nusantara (PENA) program is an initiative by the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia launched in November 2022. This program is designed to empower Beneficiary Families (KPM) of social assistance to achieve financial independence and no longer depend on social assistance. Through PENA, KPM receives business capital assistance of up to Rp5 million, skills training, and business mentoring. The aim is to increase KPM's income to exceed the Regional Minimum Wage (UMK).

Until March 2024, the PENA program has successfully graduated 21,333 KPM, which means they have been released from social assistance participation as they are considered financially independent. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation indicate that 98.9% of the 11,352 KPM who received PENA assistance experienced an increase in income after participating in this program. The PENA program also offers various support, including business and production strengthening with assistance of IDR 5-6 million per KPM. This assistance is provided in the form of business facilities and infrastructure, such as carts, sewing machines, or other tools according to the needs of each KPM's business. In addition to capital assistance, KPM also receives skills training, guidance in packaging, marketing, and financial literacy to ensure their businesses can grow and be sustainable.

One example of the implementation of this program is found in the city of Pekalongan, where 30 KPM have joined the PENA Program. They receive capital and business training worth Rp2.4 million, as well as assistance until their businesses run smoothly and successfully. The ultimate goal is for KPM to graduate from being social assistance recipients and achieve economic independence. Overall, the PENA Program is a tangible effort by the government to encourage economic independence among underprivileged communities through the provision of business capital, skills training, and business assistance, so that they can escape the poverty line and no longer depend on social assistance.

# 2. "_Skill Our Future_" Initiative

The "Skill Our Future" program is the result of a collaboration between UNDP Indonesia and Biji-biji Initiative, launched in January 2025 with the aim of empowering Indonesian youth through the enhancement of digital skills and career preparation that aligns with current industry needs. This program aims to reach 30,000 youth across Indonesia.

Indonesia has great potential to become the world's digital economic center. However, to realize this potential, an increase in digital skills among the youth is necessary. The "Skill Our Future" program is here to provide access to quality education and training, supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the fields of education and decent work.

This program offers various training that includes basic digital skills such as the use of Microsoft Office, data analysis, and project management. Additionally, there is an entrepreneurship program aimed at equipping participants with the knowledge and skills to start and manage their own businesses. Besides digital skills training, "Skill Our Future" also includes a sub-program called LEAD+ designed to develop leadership skills and peer mentoring abilities. This program is intended for 1,200 selected participants aged 18-24 and includes live training sessions as well as self-directed learning with materials such as leadership, public speaking, interpersonal skills, digital media, and project management.

The collaboration between UNDP Indonesia and Biji-biji Initiative in this program reflects the commitment of both parties to accelerate the empowerment of Indonesian youth in the digital era. By combining UNDP's experience in sustainable development and Biji-biji Initiative's expertise in innovation and education, this program is expected to not only enhance the digital skills of the younger generation but also create a sustainable positive impact in the national work ecosystem. Through "Skill Our Future," Indonesian youth are expected to seize opportunities in the digital era and contribute significantly to the growth of Indonesia's digital economy.

# 3. Collaboration with Microsoft for Youth Empowerment

In May 2023, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Microsoft announced a regional collaboration to empower two million youth in Asia, including Indonesia, with digital skills and artificial intelligence (AI). This initiative targets digitally underserved and marginalized communities, aiming to equip them with the skills necessary to succeed in the digital era.

This collaboration aims to bridge the digital skills gap and provide equal opportunities for the youth in Asia. The main focus of this initiative includes:

1. **Digital Skills Training**: Offering a comprehensive training program that encompasses basic digital literacy to advanced AI skills.
2. **Access to Technology and Resources**: Ensuring that young people have access to the necessary learning tools and platforms to enhance their skills.
3. **Increase in Employment Opportunities**: Providing certification, project-based internships, and job opportunities to enhance youth employability.

Indonesia, with its dynamic young population, is the first country to implement this program. This initiative is expected to reduce unemployment rates and empower Indonesian youth to contribute to digital economic growth. The collaboration between UNDP and Microsoft reflects a shared commitment to harness technology in addressing the challenges faced by the younger generation. By providing digital skills and creating an ecosystem that supports innovation, this initiative aims to promote inclusive social and economic development in Asia. Through this collaboration, it is hoped that the youth in Asia, particularly in Indonesia, can seize opportunities in the digital era and significantly contribute to sustainable development in their region.

# 4. District Empowerment Program in Papua

The UNDP, in collaboration with the local government of Papua, launched a district empowerment program in 2006. This program is an initiative aimed at enhancing the capacity of the indigenous Papuan community through a community-based approach. The main focus of this program is the direct management of funds by the local community to achieve independence and reduce socio-economic disparities.

The Main Objective of the District Empowerment Program in Papua:

1. Enhancing the Capacity of Local Communities: This program is designed to strengthen the role of indigenous Papuan communities in managing resources and making development decisions at the district level.
2. Independent Fund Management: Assistance funds are provided directly to the community and managed by the local population. This aims to ensure that development is more aligned with the needs of the local community, rather than merely being dictated by top-down policies.
3. Economic and Social Empowerment: Encouraging community-based small and medium enterprises, supporting local agricultural, fisheries, and livestock activities, and enhancing access to education and healthcare services.
4. Local Infrastructure Improvement: The aid funds are also utilized for the development of basic infrastructure, such as village roads, schools, and health service centers.

The approaches and methods used in the implementation of empowerment programs in Papua are participatory approaches where local communities are involved from the planning stage to project implementation. Additionally, technical assistance and training are necessary, where UNDP collaborates with local institutions to provide training in financial management, entrepreneurship, and village governance. Besides these two methods, collaboration with the local government is also required, as this program is not only community-based but also receives support from the Papua local government to ensure sustainability and long-term impact. Since its launch, this program is expected to enhance the economic independence of the Papuan community, reduce development disparities between regions, and strengthen governance capacity at the district level.

# 5. Community-Based Development Approach

The UNDP implements poverty alleviation programs with a community-based development approach. This approach involves six main programs: sustainable livelihoods, micro-enterprise development, community-based housing, infrastructure rehabilitation, social transformation and gender empowerment, as well as community-based environmental management. The aim is to promote independence, active participation, and justice in development.

The community-based development approach implemented by UNDP in the poverty alleviation program emphasizes the active participation of local communities in every stage of development. This approach aims to promote independence, justice, and sustainability through six main programs:

1. Sustainable Livelihood

This program focuses on enhancing the capacity of communities to manage local resources efficiently and sustainably. Through training and mentoring, communities are encouraged to identify local economic potentials, such as organic farming, handicrafts, or ecotourism, which can increase income without harming the environment.

2. Micro Business Development

To encourage economic independence, UNDP supports the development of micro-enterprises by providing access to capital, business management training, and marketing. This program assists individuals and small business groups to grow and contribute to the local economy, while also creating new job opportunities in their communities.

3. Community-Based Housing

This housing program involves the community in the planning, construction, and maintenance of habitable living spaces. Through a participatory approach, the community can ensure that the design and materials used are in accordance with local needs and culture, as well as being economically affordable.

4. Infrastructure Rehabilitation

UNDP collaborates with communities to improve and build basic infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, clean water facilities, and sanitation. The direct involvement of the community in this project ensures that the infrastructure built truly addresses their needs and enhances accessibility and quality of life.

5. Social Transformation and Gender Empowerment

This program aims to change the norms and social practices that hinder gender equality and social inclusion. Through education, community dialogue, and women's empowerment, UNDP encourages the creation of an environment that supports the full participation of all members of society in the development process.

6. Community-Based Environmental Management

The awareness of the importance of a healthy environment serves as the foundation of this program. The community is involved in the conservation of natural resources, waste management, and other green initiatives. This approach ensures that environmental preservation efforts align with local needs and knowledge, while also providing direct benefits to the community.

Through various programs, UNDP is committed to supporting the government and the people of Indonesia in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and realizing an inclusive and prosperous society.
